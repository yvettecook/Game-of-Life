Rules:

* Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives onto the next generation
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding
* And dead cell wth exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproductions

Exercises:

* Always use 40 minutes
* When you finish, delete your code
* First time, try to code the rules as they are, without any restrictions, in 40 minutes. pairing.  As well as you can, rather than finishing
* Second time, do the same thing, but with no 'if' statements
* Third time, between boundaries not going to be any return values. No method returns a value. Ever. But with if statements
* Fourth time, not allowed to use any primitives (no numbers, strings, symbols, booleans)
* Fifth time, not allowed to talk with partner
* Sixth time, not allowed to use objects to create classes
